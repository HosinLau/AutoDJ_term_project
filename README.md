In the Application folder, you will find the actual automatic DJ application.
In the Demos folder, you will find some old demos that were developed during my thesis year. Kept as a reference, they might be deprecated and need some adaptations before they will work.
In the TestScripts folder, you will find some old test scripts, model training files, etc. that were used during this project. Kept as a reference, they might be deprecated and might need some adaptations before they will work.
